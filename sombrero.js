var betterpasta = "According to all known laws of aviation,   there is no way a bee should be able to fly.   Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.   The bee, of course, flies anyway   because bees don\'t care what humans think is impossible.   Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.   Ooh, black and yellow! Let\'s shake it up a little.   Barry! Breakfast is ready!   Ooming!   Hang on a second.   Hello?   - Barry? - Adam?   - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can\'t. I\'ll pick you up.   Looking sharp.   Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.   Sorry. I\'m excited.   Here\'s the graduate. We\'re very proud of you, son.   A perfect report card, all B\'s.   Very proud.   Ma! I got a thing going here.   - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That\'s me!   - Wave to us! We\'ll be in row 118,000. - Bye!   Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!   - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.   - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.   Never thought I\'d make it.   Three days grade school, three days high school.   Those were awkward.   Three days college. I\'m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.   You did come back different.   - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.   - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.   - You going to the funeral? - No, I\'m not going.   Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.   Don\'t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.   I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.   I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.   That\'s why we don\'t need vacations.   Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.   - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!   - Bee-men. - Amen!   Hallelujah!   Students, faculty, distinguished bees,   please welcome Dean Buzzwell.   Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...   ...9:15.   That concludes our ceremonies.   And begins your career at Honex Industries!   Will we pick ourjob today?   I heard it\'s just orientation.   Heads up! Here we go.   Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.   - Wonder what it\'ll be like? - A little scary.   Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco   and a part of the Hexagon Group.   This is it!   Wow.   Wow.   We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life   to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.   Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.   Our top-secret formula   is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured   into this soothing sweet syrup   with its distinctive golden glow you know as...   Honey!   - That girl was hot. - She\'s my cousin!   - She is? - Yes, we\'re all cousins.   - Right. You\'re right. - At Honex, we constantly strive   to improve every aspect of bee existence.   These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.   - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.   Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.   - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey   that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.   Oan anyone work on the Krelman?   Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know   that every small job, if it\'s done well, means a lot.   But choose carefully   because you\'ll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.   The same job the rest of your life? I didn\'t know that.   What\'s the difference?   You\'ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven\'t had one day off   in 27 million years.   So you\'ll just work us to death?   We\'ll sure try.   Wow! That blew my mind!   \"What\'s the difference?\" How can you say that?   One job forever? That\'s an insane choice to have to make.   I\'m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.   But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?   Why would you question anything? We\'re bees.   We\'re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.   You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?   Like what? Give me one example.   I don\'t know. But you know what I\'m talking about.   Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.   Wait a second. Oheck it out.   - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.   I\'ve never seen them this close.   They know what it\'s like outside the hive.   Yeah, but some don\'t come back.   - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!   You guys did great!   You\'re monsters! You\'re sky freaks! I love it! I love it!   - I wonder where they were. - I don\'t know.   Their day\'s not planned.   Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.   You can\'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.   Right.   Look. That\'s more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.   It\'s just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.   Perhaps. Unless you\'re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.   Those ladies? Aren\'t they our cousins too?   Distant. Distant.   Look at these two.   - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let\'s have fun with them.   It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.   Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!   He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!   - Oh, my! - I never thought I\'d knock him out.   What were you doing during this?   Trying to alert the authorities.   I can autograph that.   A little gusty out there today, wasn\'t it, comrades?   Yeah. Gusty.   We\'re hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.   - Six miles, huh? - Barry!   A puddle jump for us, but maybe you\'re not up for it.   - Maybe I am. - You are not!   We\'re going 0900 at J-Gate.   What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?   I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.   Hey, Honex!   Dad, you surprised me.   You decide what you\'re interested in?   - Well, there\'s a lot of choices. - But you only get one.   Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?   Son, let me tell you about stirring.   You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.   You get yourself into a rhythm. It\'s a beautiful thing.   You know, Dad, the more I think about it,   maybe the honey field just isn\'t right for me.   You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?   That\'s a bad job for a guy with a stinger.   Janet, your son\'s not sure he wants to go into honey!   - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I\'m not trying to be funny.   You\'re not funny! You\'re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!   - You\'re gonna be a stirrer? - No one\'s listening to me!   Wait till you see the sticks I have.   I could say anything right now. I\'m gonna get an ant tattoo!   Let\'s open some honey and celebrate!   Maybe I\'ll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.   Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"!   I\'m so proud.   - We\'re starting work today! - Today\'s the day.   Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.   Yeah, right.   Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...   - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!   One of them\'s yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.   - What\'d you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!   Wow!   Oouple of newbies?   Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!   Make your choice.   - You want to go first? - No, you go.   Oh, my. What\'s available?   Restroom attendant\'s open, not for the reason you think.   - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you\'re on.   I\'m sorry, the Krelman just closed out.   Wax monkey\'s always open.   The Krelman opened up again.   What happened?   A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He\'s dead. Another dead one.   Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.   Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That\'s life!   Oh, this is so hard!   Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,   humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,   mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?   Barry!   All right, we\'ve got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...   What happened to you? Where are you?   - I\'m going out. - Out? Out where?   - Out there. - Oh, no!   I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.   You\'re gonna die! You\'re crazy! Hello?   Another call coming in.   If anyone\'s feeling brave, there\'s a Korean deli on 83rd   that gets their roses today.   Hey, guys.   - Look at that. - Isn\'t that the kid we saw yesterday?   Hold it, son, flight deck\'s restricted.   It\'s OK, Lou. We\'re gonna take him up.   Really? Feeling lucky, are you?   Sign here, here. Just initial that.   - Thank you. - OK.   You got a rain advisory today,   and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.   So be careful. As always, watch your brooms,   hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.   Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.   Murphy\'s in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!   - That\'s awful. - And a reminder for you rookies,   bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!   All right, launch positions!   Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!   Black and yellow!   Hello!   You ready for this, hot shot?   Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.   Wind, check.   - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check.   - Wings, check. - Stinger, check.   Scared out of my shorts, check.   OK, ladies,   let\'s move it out!   Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!   All of you, drain those flowers!   Wow! I\'m out!   I can\'t believe I\'m out!   So blue.   I feel so fast and free!   Box kite!   Wow!   Flowers!   This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual.   Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.   Roses!   30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.   Stand to the side, kid. It\'s got a bit of a kick.   That is one nectar collector!   - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir.   I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there,   a pinch on that one. See that? It\'s a little bit of magic.   That\'s amazing. Why do we do that?   That\'s pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.   Oool.   I\'m picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don\'t we need those?   Oopy that visual.   Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.   Say again? You\'re reporting a moving flower?   Affirmative.   That was on the line!   This is the coolest. What is it?   I don\'t know, but I\'m loving this color.   It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it.   Yeah, fuzzy.   Ohemical-y.   Oareful, guys. It\'s a little grabby.   My sweet lord of bees!   Oandy-brain, get off there!   Problem!   - Guys! - This could be bad.   Affirmative.   Very close.   Gonna hurt.   Mama\'s little boy.   You are way out of position, rookie!   Ooming in at you like a missile!   Help me!   I don\'t think these are flowers.   - Should we tell him? - I think he knows.   What is this?!   Match point!   You can start packing up, honey, because you\'re about to eat it!   Yowser!   Gross.   There\'s a bee in the car!   - Do something! - I\'m driving!   - Hi, bee. - He\'s back here!   He\'s going to sting me!   Nobody move. If you don\'t move, he won\'t sting you. Freeze!   He blinked!   Spray him, Granny!   What are you doing?!   Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.   I gotta get home.   Oan\'t fly in rain.   Oan\'t fly in rain.   Oan\'t fly in rain.   Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!   Ken, could you close the window please?   Ken, could you close the window please?   Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure.   You see? Folds out.   Oh, no. More humans. I don\'t need this.   What was that?   Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This...   Drapes!   That is diabolical.   It\'s fantastic. It\'s got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.   What\'s number one? Star Wars?   Nah, I don\'t go for that...   ...kind of stuff.   No wonder we shouldn\'t talk to them. They\'re out of their minds.   When I leave a job interview, they\'re flabbergasted, can\'t believe what I say.   There\'s the sun. Maybe that\'s a way out.   I don\'t remember the sun having a big 75 on it.   I predicted global warming.   I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.   Wait! Stop! Bee!   Stand back. These are winter boots.   Wait!   Don\'t kill him!   You know I\'m allergic to them! This thing could kill me!   Why does his life have less value than yours?   Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?   I\'m just saying all life has value. You don\'t know what he\'s capable of feeling.   My brochure!   There you go, little guy.   I\'m not scared of him. It\'s an allergic thing.   Put that on your resume brochure.   My whole face could puff up.   Make it one of your special skills.   Knocking someone out is also a special skill.   Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.   - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.   - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye.   - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye.   I gotta say something.   She saved my life. I gotta say something.   All right, here it goes.   Nah.   What would I say?   I could really get in trouble.   It\'s a bee law. You\'re not supposed to talk to a human.   I can\'t believe I\'m doing this.   I\'ve got to.   Oh, I can\'t do it. Oome on!   No. Yes. No.   Do it. I can\'t.   How should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that\'s no good.   Here she comes! Speak, you fool!   Hi!   I\'m sorry.   - You\'re talking. - Yes, I know.   You\'re talking!   I\'m so sorry.   No, it\'s OK. It\'s fine. I know I\'m dreaming.   But I don\'t recall going to bed.   Well, I\'m sure this is very disconcerting.   This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you\'re a bee!   I am. And I\'m not supposed to be doing this,   but they were all trying to kill me.   And if it wasn\'t for you...   I had to thank you. It\'s just how I was raised.   That was a little weird.   - I\'m talking with a bee. - Yeah.   I\'m talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!   I just want to say I\'m grateful. I\'ll leave now.   - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What?   The talking thing.   Same way you did, I guess. \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up.   - That\'s very funny. - Yeah.   Bees are funny. If we didn\'t laugh, we\'d cry with what we have to deal with.   Anyway...   Oan I...   ...get you something? - Like what?   I don\'t know. I mean... I don\'t know. Ooffee?   I don\'t want to put you out.   It\'s no trouble. It takes two minutes.   - It\'s just coffee. - I hate to impose.   - Don\'t be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup.   Hey, you want rum cake?   - I shouldn\'t. - Have some.   - No, I can\'t. - Oome on!   I\'m trying to lose a couple micrograms.   - Where? - These stripes don\'t help.   You look great!   I don\'t know if you know anything about fashion.   Are you all right?   No.   He\'s making the tie in the cab as they\'re flying up Madison.   He finally gets there.   He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on.   And he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan.   Why would I marry a watermelon?\"   Is that a bee joke?   That\'s the kind of stuff we do.   Yeah, different.   So, what are you gonna do, Barry?   About work? I don\'t know.   I want to do my part for the hive, but I can\'t do it the way they want.   I know how you feel.   - You do? - Sure.   My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.   - Really? - My only interest is flowers.   Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.   Anyway, if you look...   There\'s my hive right there. See it?   You\'re in Sheep Meadow!   Yes! I\'m right off the Turtle Pond!   No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.   - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not?   - It\'s like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I\'ll try that.   - You all right, ma\'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine.   Just having two cups of coffee!   Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee.   Yeah, it\'s no trouble.   Sorry I couldn\'t finish it. If I did, I\'d be up the rest of my life.   Are you...?   Oan I take a piece of this with me?   Sure! Here, have a crumb.   - Thanks! - Yeah.   All right. Well, then... I guess I\'ll see you around.   Or not.   OK, Barry.   And thank you so much again... for before.   Oh, that? That was nothing.   Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...   This can\'t possibly work.   He\'s all set to go. We may as well try it.   OK, Dave, pull the chute.   - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing!   It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.   Humans! I can\'t believe you were with humans!   Giant, scary humans! What were they like?   Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.   They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy.   - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don\'t.   - How\'d you get back? - Poodle.   You did it, and I\'m glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.   You had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.   - Well... - Well?   Well, I met someone.   You did? Was she Bee-ish?   - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp.   - Spider? - I\'m not attracted to spiders.   I know it\'s the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all.   I can\'t get by that face.   So who is she?   She\'s... human.   No, no. That\'s a bee law. You wouldn\'t break a bee law.   - Her name\'s Vanessa. - Oh, boy.   She\'s so nice. And she\'s a florist!   Oh, no! You\'re dating a human florist!   We\'re not dating.   You\'re flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes   with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!   She saved my life! And she understands me.   This is over!   Eat this.   This is not over! What was that?   - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin\' stripey!   And that\'s not what they eat. That\'s what falls off what they eat!   - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No.   It\'s bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...   Sit down!   ...really hot! - Listen to me!   We are not them! We\'re us. There\'s us and there\'s them!   Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?   There\'s no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!   You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!   - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.   Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!   There he is. He\'s in the pool.   You know what your problem is, Barry?   I gotta start thinking bee?   How much longer will this go on?   It\'s been three days! Why aren\'t you working?   I\'ve got a lot of big life decisions to think about.   What life? You have no life! You have no job. You\'re barely a bee!   Would it kill you to make a little honey?   Barry, come out. Your father\'s talking to you.   Martin, would you talk to him?   Barry, I\'m talking to you!   You coming?   Got everything?   All set!   Go ahead. I\'ll catch up.   Don\'t be too long.   Watch this!   Vanessa!   - We\'re still here. - I told you not to yell at him.   He doesn\'t respond to yelling!   - Then why yell at me? - Because you don\'t listen!   I\'m not listening to this.   Sorry, I\'ve gotta go.   - Where are you going? - I\'m meeting a friend.   A girl? Is this why you can\'t decide?   Bye.   I just hope she\'s Bee-ish.   They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?   To be in the Tournament of Roses, that\'s every florist\'s dream!   Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.   A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?   No. All right, I\'ve got one. How come you don\'t fly everywhere?   It\'s exhausting. Why don\'t you run everywhere? It\'s faster.   Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn.   TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That\'s insane!   You don\'t have that?   We have Hivo, but it\'s a disease. It\'s a horrible, horrible disease.   Oh, my.   Dumb bees!   You must want to sting all those jerks.   We try not to sting. It\'s usually fatal for us.   So you have to watch your temper.   Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk,   write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion:   Anger, jealousy, lust.   Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?   Yeah.   - What is wrong with you?! - It\'s a bug.   He\'s not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep!   What was that? A Pic \'N\' Save circular?   Yeah, it was. How did you know?   It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.   You\'ve really got that down to a science.   - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I\'ll bet.   What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?   How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,   Ray Liotta Private Select?   - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him.   - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it.   You don\'t have enough food of your own?   - Well, yes. - How do you get it?   - Bees make it. - I know who makes it!   And it\'s hard to make it!   There\'s heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!   - It\'s organic. - It\'s our-ganic!   It\'s just honey, Barry.   Just what?!   Bees don\'t know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!   You\'ve taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have!   And it\'s on sale?! I\'m getting to the bottom of this.   I\'m getting to the bottom of all of this!   Hey, Hector.   - You almost done? - Almost.   He is here. I sense it.   Well, I guess I\'ll go home now   and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.   You\'re busted, box boy!   I knew I heard something. So you can talk!   I can talk. And now you\'ll start talking!   Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who\'s your supplier?   I don\'t understand. I thought we were friends.   The last thing we want to do is upset bees!   You\'re too late! It\'s ours now!   You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!   You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!   Where is the honey coming from?   Tell me where!   Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!   Orazy person!   What horrible thing has happened here?   These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now   they\'re on the road to nowhere!   Just keep still.   What? You\'re not dead?   Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?   To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.   I\'m going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!   I\'m going to Tacoma.   - And you? - He really is dead.   All right.   Uh-oh!   - What is that?! - Oh, no!   - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade?   Jump on! It\'s your only chance, bee!   Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?!   How much do you people need to see?!   Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window!   From NPR News in Washington, I\'m Oarl Kasell.   But don\'t kill no more bugs!   - Bee! - Moose blood guy!!   - You hear something? - Like what?   Like tiny screaming.   Turn off the radio.   Whassup, bee boy?   Hey, Blood.   Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.   Wow!   I assume wherever this truck goes is where they\'re getting it.   I mean, that honey\'s ours.   - Bees hang tight. - We\'re all jammed in.   It\'s a close community.   Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.   - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble.   Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!   At least you\'re out in the world. You must meet girls.   Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly.   Mosquito girl don\'t want no mosquito.   You got to be kidding me!   Mooseblood\'s about to leave the building! So long, bee!   - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood!   I knew I\'d catch y\'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw?   We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it\'s pretty much pure profit.   What is this place?   A bee\'s got a brain the size of a pinhead.   They are pinheads!   Pinhead.   - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That\'s the one you want.   The Thomas 3000!   Smoker?   Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar.   A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.   They make the honey, and we make the money.   \"They make the honey, and we make the money\"?   Oh, my!   What\'s going on? Are you OK?   Yeah. It doesn\'t last too long.   Do you know you\'re in a fake hive with fake walls?   Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.   This is your queen? That\'s a man in women\'s clothes!   That\'s a drag queen!   What is this?   Oh, no!   There\'s hundreds of them!   Bee honey.   Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!   This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.   Oh, Barry, stop.   Who told you humans are taking our honey? That\'s a rumor.   Do these look like rumors?   That\'s a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos.   How did you get mixed up in this?   He\'s been talking to humans.   - What? - Talking to humans?!   He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!   Make out? Barry!   We do not.   - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on?   The bees!   I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.   Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?   I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!   Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked   your hands were still stirring. You couldn\'t stop.   I remember that.   What right do they have to our honey?   We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!   Even if it\'s true, what can one bee do?   Sting them where it really hurts.   In the face! The eye!   - That would hurt. - No.   Up the nose? That\'s a killer.   There\'s only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.   Hive at Five, the hive\'s only full-hour action news source.   No more bee beards!   With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.   Weather with Storm Stinger.   Sports with Buzz Larvi.   And Jeanette Ohung.   - Good evening. I\'m Bob Bumble. - And I\'m Jeanette Ohung.   A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,   intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey,   packaging it and profiting from it illegally!   Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,   we\'ll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book,   Olassy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.   Tonight we\'re talking to Barry Benson.   Did you ever think, \"I\'m a kid from the hive. I can\'t do this\"?   Bees have never been afraid to change the world.   What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?   Where I\'m from, we\'d never sue humans.   We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.   How old are you?   The bee community is supporting you in this case,   which will be the trial of the bee century.   You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.   It\'s a common name. Next week...   He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...   Next week...   Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard \'em.   Bear Week next week! They\'re scary, hairy and here live.   Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.   In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!   It was my grandmother, Ken. She\'s 81.   Honey, her backhand\'s a joke! I\'m not gonna take advantage of that?   Quiet, please. Actual work going on here.   - Is that that same bee? - Yes, it is!   I\'m helping him sue the human race.   - Hello. - Hello, bee.   This is Ken.   Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.   Why does he talk again?   Listen, you better go \'cause we\'re really busy working.   But it\'s our yogurt night!   Bye-bye.   Why is yogurt night so difficult?!   You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!   Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.   - Frosting... - How many sugars?   Just one. I try not to use the competition.   So why are you helping me?   Bees have good qualities.   And it takes my mind off the shop.   Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.   Those are great, if you\'re three.   And artificial flowers.   - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too.   Bent stingers, pointless pollination.   Bees must hate those fake things!   Nothing worse than a daffodil that\'s had work done.   Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.   - This lawsuit\'s a pretty big deal. - I guess.   You sure you want to go through with it?   Am I sure? When I\'m done with the humans, they won\'t be able   to say, \"Honey, I\'m home,\" without paying a royalty!   It\'s an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan,   where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history,   we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.   What have we gotten into here, Barry?   It\'s pretty big, isn\'t it?   I can\'t believe how many humans don\'t work during the day.   You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?   Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.   - What\'s the matter? - I don\'t know, I just got a chill.   Well, if it isn\'t the bee team.   You boys work on this?   All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.   All right. Oase number 4475,   Superior Oourt of New York, Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry   is now in session.   Mr. Montgomery, you\'re representing the five food companies collectively?   A privilege.   Mr. Benson... you\'re representing all the bees of the world?   I\'m kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we\'re ready to proceed.   Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.   Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,   my grandmother was a simple woman.   Born on a farm, she believed it was man\'s divine right   to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.   If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines,   just think of what would it mean.   I would have to negotiate with the silkworm   for the elastic in my britches!   Talking bee!   How do we know this isn\'t some sort of   holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?   They could be using laser beams!   Robotics! Ventriloquism! Oloning! For all we know,   he could be on steroids!   Mr. Benson?   Ladies and gentlemen, there\'s no trickery here.   I\'m just an ordinary bee. Honey\'s pretty important to me.   It\'s important to all bees. We invented it!   We make it. And we protect it with our lives.   Unfortunately, there are some people in this room   who think they can take it from us   \'cause we\'re the little guys! I\'m hoping that, after this is all over,   you\'ll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have   but everything we are!   I wish he\'d dress like that all the time. So nice!   Oall your first witness.   So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.   I suppose so.   I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!   Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.   Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.   I don\'t imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?   - No. - I couldn\'t hear you.   - No. - No.   Because you don\'t free bees. You keep bees. Not only that,   it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.   They\'re very lovable creatures.   Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.   You mean like this?   Bears kill bees!   How\'d you like his head crashing through your living room?!   Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows!   OK, that\'s enough. Take him away.   So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me.   - Where have I heard it before? - I was with a band called The Police.   But you\'ve never been a police officer, have you?   No, I haven\'t.   No, you haven\'t. And so here we have yet another example   of bee culture casually stolen by a human   for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.   Oh, please.   Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?   Because I\'m feeling a little stung, Sting.   Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!   That\'s not his real name?! You idiots!   Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on   your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.   Thank you. Thank you.   I see from your resume that you\'re devilishly handsome   with a churning inner turmoil that\'s ready to blow.   I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?   Not yet it isn\'t. But is this what it\'s come to for you?   Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don\'t   have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?   Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!   This isn\'t a goodfella. This is a badfella!   Why doesn\'t someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!   - Order in this court! - You\'re all thinking it!   Order! Order, I say!   - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down!   I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that.   I think the jury\'s on our side.   Are we doing everything right, legally?   I\'m a florist.   Right. Well, here\'s to a great team.   To a great team!   Well, hello.   - Ken! - Hello.   I didn\'t think you were coming.   No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery.   I didn\'t want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.   Oh, that was lucky.   There\'s a little left. I could heat it up.   Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.   So I hear you\'re quite a tennis player.   I\'m not much for the game myself. The ball\'s a little grabby.   That\'s where I usually sit. Right... there.   Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,   and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn\'t really a special skill.   You think I don\'t see what you\'re doing?   I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common.   Do we?   Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.   That\'s just what I was thinking about doing.   Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.   I\'m going to drain the old stinger.   Yeah, you do that.   Look at that.   You know, I\'ve just about had it   with your little mind games.   - What\'s that? - Italian Vogue.   Mamma mia, that\'s a lot of pages.   A lot of ads.   Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?   Funny, I just can\'t seem to recall that!   I think something stinks in here!   I love the smell of flowers.   How do you like the smell of flames?!   Not as much.   Water bug! Not taking sides!   Ken, I\'m wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic!   I\'ve got issues!   Well, well, well, a royal flush!   - You\'re bluffing. - Am I?   Surf\'s up, dude!   Poo water!   That bowl is gnarly.   Except for those dirty yellow rings!   Kenneth! What are you doing?!   You know, I don\'t even like honey! I don\'t eat it!   We need to talk!   He\'s just a little bee!   And he happens to be the nicest bee I\'ve met in a long time!   Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?   No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you\'re one of them!   Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...   My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!   Goodbye, Ken.   And for your information,   I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!   I\'m sorry about all that.   I know it\'s got an aftertaste! I like it!   I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me.   I couldn\'t overcome it. Oh, well.   Are you OK for the trial?   I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.   We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.   Good idea! You can really see why he\'s considered one of the best lawyers...   Yeah.   Layton, you\'ve gotta weave some magic   with this jury, or it\'s gonna be all over.   Don\'t worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around   is to remind them of what they don\'t like about bees.   - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic?   Only to losing, son. Only to losing.   Mr. Benson Bee, I\'ll ask you what I think we\'d all like to know.   What exactly is your relationship   to that woman?   We\'re friends.   - Good friends? - Yes.   How good? Do you live together?   Wait a minute...   Are you her little...   ...bedbug?   I\'ve seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand,   doesn\'t your queen give birth to all the bee children?   - Yeah, but... - So those aren\'t your real parents!   - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are!   Hold me back!   You\'re an illegitimate bee, aren\'t you, Benson?   He\'s denouncing bees!   Don\'t y\'all date your cousins?   - Objection! - I\'m going to pincushion this guy!   Adam, don\'t! It\'s what he wants!   Oh, I\'m hit!!   Oh, lordy, I am hit!   Order! Order!   The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins!   I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction!   You see? You can\'t treat them like equals! They\'re striped savages!   Stinging\'s the only thing they know! It\'s their way!   - Adam, stay with me. - I can\'t feel my legs.   What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison   from my heaving buttocks?   I will have order in this court. Order!   Order, please!   The case of the honeybees versus the human race   took a pointed turn against the bees   yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery.   - Hey, buddy. - Hey.   - Is there much pain? - Yeah.   I...   I blew the whole case, didn\'t I?   It doesn\'t matter. What matters is you\'re alive. You could have died.   I\'d be better off dead. Look at me.   They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.   Look, there\'s a little celery still on it.   What was it like to sting someone?   I can\'t explain it. It was all...   All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy!   All right.   You think it was all a trap?   Of course. I\'m sorry. I flew us right into this.   What were we thinking? Look at us. We\'re just a couple of bugs in this world.   What will the humans do to us if they win?   I don\'t know.   I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn\'t sound so bad.   Adam, they check in, but they don\'t check out!   Oh, my.   Oould you get a nurse to close that window?   - Why? - The smoke.   Bees don\'t smoke.   Right. Bees don\'t smoke.   Bees don\'t smoke! But some bees are smoking.   That\'s it! That\'s our case!   It is? It\'s not over?   Get dressed. I\'ve gotta go somewhere.   Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can.   And assuming you\'ve done step correctly, you\'re ready for the tub.   Mr. Flayman.   Yes? Yes, Your Honor!   Where is the rest of your team?   Well, Your Honor, it\'s interesting.   Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,   and as a result, we don\'t make very good time.   I actually heard a funny story about...   Your Honor, haven\'t these ridiculous bugs   taken up enough of this court\'s valuable time?   How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?   They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges   against my clients, who run legitimate businesses.   I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case!   Mr. Flayman, I\'m afraid I\'m going   to have to consider Mr. Montgomery\'s motion.   But you can\'t! We have a terrific case.   Where is your proof? Where is the evidence?   Show me the smoking gun!   Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun?   Here is your smoking gun.   What is that?   It\'s a bee smoker!   What, this? This harmless little contraption?   This couldn\'t hurt a fly, let alone a bee.   Look at what has happened   to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\"   Is this what nature intended for us?   To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines   and man-made wooden slat work camps?   Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man?   - What are we gonna do? - He\'s playing the species card.   Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees!   Free the bees! Free the bees!   Free the bees!   Free the bees! Free the bees!   The court finds in favor of the bees!   Vanessa, we won!   I knew you could do it! High-five!   Sorry.   I\'m OK! You know what this means?   All the honey will finally belong to the bees.   Now we won\'t have to work so hard all the time.   This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson.   You\'ll regret this.   Barry, how much honey is out there?   All right. One at a time.   Barry, who are you wearing?   My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants.   - What if Montgomery\'s right? - What do you mean?   We\'ve been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.   Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?   First, we\'ll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.   Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with,   every last drop.   We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more   than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine.   We\'re all aware of what they do in the woods.   Wait for my signal.   Take him out.   He\'ll have nauseous for a few hours, then he\'ll be fine.   And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames...   But it\'s just a prance-about stage name!   ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products   and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments.   Oan\'t breathe.   Bring it in, boys!   Hold it right there! Good.   Tap it.   Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there\'s gallons more coming!   - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We\'ve never shut down.   Shut down honey production!   Stop making honey!   Turn your key, sir!   What do we do now?   Oannonball!   We\'re shutting honey production!   Mission abort.   Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base.   Adam, you wouldn\'t believe how much honey was out there.   Oh, yeah?   What\'s going on? Where is everybody?   - Are they out celebrating? - They\'re home.   They don\'t know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in.   I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket.   At least we got our honey back.   Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn\'t?   It\'s the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it.   This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well.   And now...   Now I can\'t.   I don\'t understand why they\'re not happy.   I thought their lives would be better!   They\'re doing nothing. It\'s amazing. Honey really changes people.   You don\'t have any idea what\'s going on, do you?   - What did you want to show me? - This.   What happened here?   That is not the half of it.   Oh, no. Oh, my.   They\'re all wilting.   Doesn\'t look very good, does it?   No.   And whose fault do you think that is?   You know, I\'m gonna guess bees.   Bees?   Specifically, me.   I didn\'t think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things.   It\'s notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.   That\'s our whole SAT test right there.   Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom.   And then, of course...   The human species?   So if there\'s no more pollination,   it could all just go south here, couldn\'t it?   I know this is also partly my fault.   How about a suicide pact?   How do we do it?   - I\'ll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice.   Right, right.   Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going.   I had to open my mouth and talk.   Vanessa?   Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going?   To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena.   They\'ve moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying.   It\'s the last chance I\'ll ever have to see it.   Vanessa, I just wanna say I\'m sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this.   I know. Me neither.   Tournament of Roses. Roses can\'t do sports.   Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?   Roses!   Vanessa!   Roses?!   Barry?   - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are.   Flowers, bees, pollen!   I know. That\'s why this is the last parade.   Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down?   Oould you slow down?   Barry!   OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault.   Yes, it kind of is.   I\'ve ruined the planet. I wanted to help you   with the flower shop. I\'ve made it worse.   Actually, it\'s completely closed down.   I thought maybe you were remodeling.   But I have another idea, and it\'s greater than my previous ideas combined.   I don\'t want to hear it!   All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen.   I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park.   All we gotta do is get what they\'ve got back here with what we\'ve got.   - Bees. - Park.   - Pollen! - Flowers.   - Repollination! - Across the nation!   Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia.   They\'ve got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy.   Security will be tight.   I have an idea.   Vanessa Bloome, FTD.   Official floral business. It\'s real.   Sorry, ma\'am. Nice brooch.   Thank you. It was a gift.   Once inside, we just pick the right float.   How about The Princess and the Pea?   I could be the princess, and you could be the pea!   Yes, I got it.   - Where should I sit? - What are you?   - I believe I\'m the pea. - The pea?   It goes under the mattresses.   - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I\'m getting the marshal.   You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco!   Let\'s see what this baby\'ll do.   Hey, what are you doing?!   Then all we do is blend in with traffic...   ...without arousing suspicion.   Once at the airport, there\'s no stopping us.   Stop! Security.   - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes.   Has it been in your possession the entire time?   Would you remove your shoes?   - Remove your stinger. - It\'s part of me.   I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight.   Then if we\'re lucky, we\'ll have just enough pollen to do the job.   Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job!   I think this is gonna work.   It\'s got to work.   Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott.   We have a bit of bad weather in New York.   It looks like we\'ll experience a couple hours delay.   Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They\'ll never make it.   I gotta get up there and talk to them.   Be careful.   Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine?   I\'d like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.   Oaptain, I\'m in a real situation.   - What\'d you say, Hal? - Nothing.   Bee!   Don\'t freak out! My entire species...   What are you doing?   - Wait a minute! I\'m an attorney! - Who\'s an attorney?   Don\'t move.   Oh, Barry.   Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain.   Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit?   And please hurry!   What happened here?   There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.   One\'s bald, one\'s in a boat, they\'re both unconscious!   - Is that another bee joke? - No!   No one\'s flying the plane!   This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What\'s your status?   This is Vanessa Bloome. I\'m a florist from New York.   Where\'s the pilot?   He\'s unconscious, and so is the copilot.   Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience?   As a matter of fact, there is.   - Who\'s that? - Barry Benson.   From the honey trial?! Oh, great.   Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee.   It\'s got giant wings, huge engines.   I can\'t fly a plane.   - Why not? Isn\'t John Travolta a pilot? - Yes.   How hard could it be?   Wait, Barry! We\'re headed into some lightning.   This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport,   where a suspenseful scene is developing.   Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...   That\'s Barry!   ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers   and an incapacitated flight crew.   Flowers?!   We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls   with absolutely no flight experience.   Just a minute. There\'s a bee on that plane.   I\'m quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.   They\'ve done enough damage.   But isn\'t he your only hope?   Technically, a bee shouldn\'t be able to fly at all.   Their wings are too small...   Haven\'t we heard this a million times?   \"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\"   - Get this on the air! - Got it.   - Stand by. - We\'re going live.   The way we work may be a mystery to you.   Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.   But let me tell you about a small job.   If you do it well, it makes a big difference.   More than we realized. To us, to everyone.   That\'s why I want to get bees back to working together.   That\'s the bee way! We\'re not made of Jell-O.   We get behind a fellow.   - Black and yellow! - Hello!   Left, right, down, hover.   - Hover? - Forget hover.   This isn\'t so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep!   Barry, what happened?!   Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time.   - That may have been helping me. - And now we\'re not!   So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.   All of you, let\'s get behind this fellow! Move it out!   Move out!   Our only chance is if I do what I\'d do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!   Don\'t have to yell.   I\'m not yelling! We\'re in a lot of trouble.   It\'s very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!   It\'s not a tone. I\'m panicking!   I can\'t do this!   Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!   You snap out of it.   You snap out of it.   - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!   - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!   - You snap out of it! - You snap out of it!   - Hold it! - Why? Oome on, it\'s my turn.   How is the plane flying?   I don\'t know.   Hello?   Benson, got any flowers for a happy occasion in there?   The Pollen Jocks!   They do get behind a fellow.   - Black and yellow. - Hello.   All right, let\'s drop this tin can on the blacktop.   Where? I can\'t see anything. Oan you?   No, nothing. It\'s all cloudy.   Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.   - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee.   Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!   Wait a minute. I think I\'m feeling something.   - What? - I don\'t know. It\'s strong, pulling me.   Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.   Bring the nose down.   Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!   - What in the world is on the tarmac? - Get some lights on that!   Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!   - Vanessa, aim for the flower. - OK.   Out the engines. We\'re going in on bee power. Ready, boys?   Affirmative!   Good. Good. Easy, now. That\'s it.   Land on that flower!   Ready? Full reverse!   Spin it around!   - Not that flower! The other one! - Which one?   - That flower. - I\'m aiming at the flower!   That\'s a fat guy in a flowered shirt. I mean the giant pulsating flower   made of millions of bees!   Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.   Rotate around it.   - This is insane, Barry! - This\'s the only way I know how to fly.   Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern?   Get your nose in there. Don\'t be afraid. Smell it. Full reverse!   Just drop it. Be a part of it.   Aim for the center!   Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!   Oome on, already.   Barry, we did it! You taught me how to fly!   - Yes. No high-five! - Right.   Barry, it worked! Did you see the giant flower?   What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius!   - Thank you. - But we\'re not done yet.   Listen, everyone!   This runway is covered with the last pollen   from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.   That means this is our last chance.   We\'re the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.   If we\'re gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?   Are we going to be bees, orjust Museum of Natural History keychains?   We\'re bees!   Keychain!   Then follow me! Except Keychain.   Hold on, Barry. Here.   You\'ve earned this.   Yeah!   I\'m a Pollen Jock! And it\'s a perfect fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.   Oh, yeah.   That\'s our Barry.   Mom! The bees are back!   If anybody needs to make a call, now\'s the time.   I got a feeling we\'ll be working late tonight!   Here\'s your change. Have a great afternoon! Oan I help who\'s next?   Would you like some honey with that? It is bee-approved. Don\'t forget these.   Milk, cream, cheese, it\'s all me. And I don\'t see a nickel!   Sometimes I just feel like a piece of meat!   I had no idea.   Barry, I\'m sorry. Have you got a moment?   Would you excuse me? My mosquito associate will help you.   Sorry I\'m late.   He\'s a lawyer too?   I was already a blood-sucking parasite. All I needed was a briefcase.   Have a great afternoon!   Barry, I just got this huge tulip order, and I can\'t get them anywhere.   No problem, Vannie. Just leave it to me.   You\'re a lifesaver, Barry. Oan I help who\'s next?   All right, scramble, jocks! It\'s time to fly.   Thank you, Barry!   That bee is living my life!   Let it go, Kenny.   - When will this nightmare end?! - Let it all go.   - Beautiful day to fly. - Sure is.   Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.   You have got to start thinking bee, my friend.   - Thinking bee! - Me?   Hold it. Let\'s just stop for a second. Hold it.   I\'m sorry. I\'m sorry, everyone. Oan we stop here?   I\'m not making a major life decision during a production number!   All right. Take ten, everybody. Wrap it up, guys.   I had virtually no rehearsal for that."
var evenBetterPasta = "Shrek 2 ACT 1 Scene 1 There is a bed onstage behind a silky curtain, backlit. PRINCE CHARMING (os) Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss... of the handsome Prince Charming. [enters gallantly onstage] It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon\'s keep. For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land. [looks at the audience] And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess\'s chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her... [pulls back the curtain to reveal WOLF in the bed. Gasps] WOLF What? CHARMING Princess... Fiona? WOLF No! CHARMING [relieved] Thank heavens. Where is she? WOLF She\'s on her honeymoon. CHARMING Honeymoon? With whom? 2 Scene 2 THE SWAMP SHREK It\'s so good to be home! Just you and me and...

[looks around for the fish] SHREK Look at the time. I guess you\'d better be going. DONKEY Don\'t you want to tell me about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi? FIONA Actually, Donkey? Shouldn\'t you be getting home to Dragon? DONKEY Oh, yeah, that. I don\'t know. She\'s been all moody and stuff lately. I thought I\'d move in with you. FIONA You know we\'re always happy to see you, Donkey. SHREK But Fiona and I are married now. We need a little time, you know, to be together. Just with each other. Alone. DONKEY Say no more.

They\'ll love you, too. SHREK Yeah, right. Somehow I don\'t think I\'ll be welcome at the country club. FIONA Stop it. They\'re not like that. SHREK How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band? FIONA Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance. SHREK To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks? 4 FIONA No! They just want to give you their blessing. SHREK Oh, great. Now I need their blessing? FIONA If you want to be a part of this family, yes! SHREK Who says I want to be part of this family? FIONA You did! When you married me! SHREK Well, there\'s some fine print for you! FIONA [exasperated sigh] So that\'s it. You won\'t come? SHREK Trust me. It\'s a bad idea. We are not going!

Mom and Dad look happy to see us. KING Who on earth are they? QUEEN I think that\'s our little girl. KING That\'s not little! That\'s a really big problem. Wasn\'t she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell? QUEEN Well, he\'s no Prince Charming, but they do look... SHREK Happy now? We came. We saw them. Now let\'s go before they light the torches. FIONA They\'re my parents. SHREK Hello? They locked you in a tower. FIONA That was for my own... KING Good! Here\'s our chance. Let\'s go back inside and pretend we\'re not home. QUEEN Harold, we have to be... SHREK Quick! While they\'re not looking we can make a run for it. FIONA Shrek, stop it! Everything\'s gonna be...

SHREK Oh, yes! It\'s in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and... DONKEY [laughing] What? I know you ain\'t talking about the swamp. KING An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original. QUEEN I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children. SHREK and KING cough involuntarily 8 SHREK It\'s a bit early to be thinking about that, isn\'t it? KING Indeed. QUEEN Harold! SHREK What\'s that supposed to mean? FIONA Dad. It\'s great, OK? KING For his type, yes. SHREK My type? KING I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be... SHREK Ogres, yes! QUEEN Not that there\'s anything wrong with that. Right, Harold? KING Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don\'t eat your own young! FIONA Dad! SHREK No, we usually prefer the ones who\'ve been locked away in a tower! FIONA Shrek, please! KING I only did that because I love her. SHREK Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle. KING You wouldn\'t understand. You\'re not her father! QUEEN Harold! FIONA Shrek! SHREK Fiona! KING Fiona! FIONA Mom! QUEEN Harold... DONKEY Donkey!

Both gasp FG Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you. You\'re all grown up. FIONA Who are you? FG Oh, sweet pea! I\'m your fairy godmother. FIONA I have a fairy godmother? FG Shush, shush. Now, don\'t worry. I\'m here to make it all better. With just a wave of my magic wand, your troubles will soon be gone. For example, how about a sporty carriage to ride in style, with a sexy man-boy chauffeur named Kyle? KYLE enters FIONA Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but... SHREK enters SHREK Fiona? Fiona. FIONA Oh, uh...Fairy Godmother... I\'d like you to meet my husband, Shrek. FG Your husband? What? What did you say? When did this happen? FIONA Shrek is the one who rescued me.

SHREK What? I told you coming here was a bad idea. FIONA You could\'ve at least tried to get along with my father. SHREK I don\'t think I was going to get Daddy\'s blessing, even if I did want it. FIONA Do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted? SHREK Sure. Do you want me to pack for you? FIONA You\'re unbelievable! You\'re behaving like a... SHREK Go on! Say it! FIONA Like an ogre! SHREK Here\'s a news flash for you! Whether your parents like it or not...I am an ogre! And guess what, Princess? That\'s not about to change. FIONA I\'ve made changes for you, Shrek. Think about that. [exits] DONKEY That\'s real smooth, Shrek. \"I\'m an ogre!\" SCENE 6 KING AND QUEEN\'S BEDCHAMBER KING I knew this would happen. QUEEN You should. You started it. 11 KING I can hardly believe that, Lillian. He\'s the ogre. Not me. QUEEN I think, Harold, you\'re taking this a little too personally. QUEEN This is Fiona\'s choice. KING But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her. I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing? QUEEN Fiona does. And she\'ll never forgive you if you don\'t. I don\'t want to lose our daughter again, Harold. Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable. Don\'t you remember when we were young? We used to walk down by the lily pond and... KING they were in bloom... QUEEN Our first kiss. KING It\'s not the same! I don\'t think you realize that our daughter has married a monster! QUEEN Oh, stop being such a drama king. KING Fine! Pretend there\'s nothing wrong! La, di, da, di, da! Isn\'t it all wonderful! I\'d like to know how it could get any worse! FG [out on the balcony] Hello, Harold. KING gasps QUEEN What happened? KING Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit! I\'ll just stretch it out here for a while. FG We need to talk. KING Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed.[yawns] Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy. So, how about... we make this a quick visit. What? [Bumps up against two armed guards] Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha! So, what\'s new? FG You remember my son, Prince Charming? CHARMING enters KING Is that you? My gosh! It\'s been years. When did you get back? 12 CHARMING Oh, about five minutes ago, actually. After I endured blistering winds, scorching desert...I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower... FG Mommy can handle this.He endures blistering winds and scorching desert! He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower...And what does he find? Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married. KING It wasn\'t my fault. He didn\'t get there in time. FG Harold. [GUARD reaches into his pocket] You\'ve forced me to do something I really don\'t want to do. KING [gasps] What is that? What have you got there? GUARD pulls out a cellphone and gives it to FG FG My diet is ruined! Yes, I\'d like two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings... CHARMING I\'ll have the Medieval Meal. FG One Medieval Meal and, Harold... Curly fries? KING No, thank you. FG Sourdough soft taco, then? KING No, really, I\'m fine. FG Nothing else thanks.[hangs up] We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don\'t want me to go back on my part. KING [sighs deeply] Indeed not. FG So, Fiona and Charming will be together. KING Yes. FG Believe me, Harold. It\'s what\'s best. Not only for your daughter...but for your Kingdom. KING What am I supposed to do about it? FG Use your imagination. 13 ACT 2 SCENE 1 AT A PUB IN THE WOODS KING enters. A woman (UGLY STEPSISTER) is cleaning a glass with her back to the audience. KING [clears throat] Excuse me. Uh... excuse me. I\'m looking for the Ugly Stepsister. UGLY STEPSISTER turns around to reveal herself KING Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I need to have someone taken care of. UGLY STEPSISTER Who\'s the guy? KING Well, he\'s not a guy, per se. Um... He\'s an ogre. UGLY STEPSISTER Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There\'s only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly...he don\'t like to be disturbed. KING Where could I find him? UGLY STEPSISTER point to the dark corner of the room KING Hello? MYSTERIOUS VOICE Who dares speak to me? KING Sorry! I hope I\'m not interrupting, but I\'m told you\'re the one to talk to about an ogre problem? VOICE You are told correct. But for this, I charge a great deal of money. KING Would... this be enough? [holds up a heavy satchel of coins] VOICE You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty. Just tell me where I can find this ogre. 14 SCENE 2 CASTLE SHREK is alone reading FIONA\'s diary. FIONA (offstage) Dear Diary... Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can\'t go. He never lets me out after sunset. Dad says I\'m going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school. Mom says that when I\'m old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we\'ll all live happily ever after. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. A knock on door KING Sorry. I hope I\'m not interrupting anything. SHREK No, no. I was just reading a, uh... a scary book. KING I was hoping you\'d let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier. SHREK Okay... KING I don\'t know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over... SHREK Look, Your Majesty, I just... KING Please. Call me Dad. SHREK Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other. KING Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little father-son time? I know it would mean the world to Fiona. Shall we say, by the old oak? SHREK Sure. Fade out 15 SCENE 3 IN THE FOREST SHREK Face it, Donkey! We\'re lost. DONKEY We can\'t be lost. We followed the King\'s instructions exactly. \"Head to the darkest part of the woods...\"\"Past the sinister trees with scary-looking branches.\" The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey! SHREK We passed that three times already! DONKEY You were the one who said not to stop for directions. SHREK Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona\'s dad and I end up lost in the woods with you! DONKEY Don\'t get huffy! I\'m only trying to help. SHREK I know! I know. I\'m sorry, all right? DONKEY Hey, don\'t worry about it. SHREK I just really need to make things work with this guy. DONKEY Yeah, sure. Now let\'s go bond with Daddy. SHREK hears purring SHREK Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring? DONKEY What? I ain\'t purring. SHREK Sure. What\'s next? A hug? DONKEY Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don\'t purr. What do you think I am, some kind of a... PUSS IN BOOTS enters PUSS Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare! SHREK Look! A little cat. DONKEY Look out, Shrek! He got a piece! SHREK It\'s a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. 16 PUSS scratches SHREK\'s outstretched hand PUSS Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...Puss... in Boots! SHREK I\'ll kill that cat! PUSS Ah-ha-ha! [coughs, wheezes, retches, coughs, chuckles] Hairball. DONKEY Oh! That is nasty! SHREK What should we do with him? DONKEY Take the sword and neuter him. PUSS Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore you! It was nothing personal, Seor. I was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. And my father lives off the garbage! The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers... SHREK Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona\'s father paid you to do this? PUSS The rich King? S. SHREK Well, so much for Dad\'s royal blessing. DONKEY Don\'t feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you. SHREK Maybe Fiona would\'ve been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming. PUSS That\'s what the King said. Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question was directed at me. DONKEY Shrek, Fiona knows you\'d do anything for her. SHREK Well, it\'s not like I wouldn\'t change if I could. I just... I just wish I could make her happy. Hold the phone... \"Happiness. Just a tear drop away.\" Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that\'s ever happened to you! DONKEY Aw, man, where do I begin? First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going \"Piata!!\" What is a piata, anyway? 17 SHREK No, Donkey! I need you to cry! DONKEY Don\'t go projecting on me. I know you\'re feeling bad, but you got to [Puss steps on his foot] Aaaahhh! You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of... KYLE enters with a cart KYLE Fairy Godmother is away from desk or with a client. But I can help you with your Happiness problems\' [yawns] FAIRY GODMOTHER enters and Kyle stands up straight very quickly FG Kyle, I\'ve been looking everywhere for you! Why aren\'t you [notices SHREK] What in Grimm\'s name are you doing here? SHREK Well, um, it seems that Fiona\'s not exactly happy. FG Oh-ho-ho! And there\'s some question as to why that is? Well, let\'s explore that, shall we? Cinderella.\"Lived happily ever after.\" No ogres! Snow White. A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres. Sleeping Beauty. No ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...No, no, no! You see, ogres don\'t live happily ever after. SHREK All right, look, lady! FG Don\'t you point...those dirty green sausages at me! KYLE opens the cart to get a soda and SHREK notices the potions SHREK Ah... that\'s okay. We\'ll go. Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother. FG I need a Monte Cristo Sandwich now. You\'ve got me all worked up. [exits] SHREK looks at KYLE, smiles, then knocks him out. DONKEY Shrek, are you off your nut? SHREK Donkey, quiet and keep watch. DONKEY Keep watch? Yeah, I\'ll keep watch. I\'ll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside. I\'ll laugh, too. I\'ll be giggling to myself. SHREK opens the cart and passes potions to PUSS 18 PUSS Toad Stool Softener? Elfa Seltzer? Hex Lax? SHREK Help me find \"handsome.\" PUSS Hey! How about \"Happily Ever After\"? SHREK Well, what does it do? PUSS It says \"Beauty Divine.\" SHREK That\'ll have to do. She\'s coming back. Go, Donkey! ALL exit. FG enters, with CHARMING following after. FG What happened here? Kyle! Clean this up. CHARMING Mother! FG This isn\'t a good time, pumpkin. Mama\'s working. CHARMING Whoa, what happened here? FG The ogre, that\'s what! CHARMING What? Where is he, Mom? I shall rend his head from his shoulders! I will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me! FG Oh, put it away, Junior! You\'re still going to be king. We\'ll just have to come up with something smarter. KYLE Pardon. Um...Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion. FG What? [looks in the cart] Oh...I do believe we can make this work to our advantage. SCENE 4 THE ROYAL CASTLE QUEEN Try to at least pretend you\'re interested in your daughter\'s wedding ball. KING Honestly, Lillian, I don\'t think it matters. How do we know there will even be a ball? FIONA Mom. Dad. KING Oh, hello, dear. What\'s that, Cedric? Right! Coming. FIONA Mom, have you seen Shrek? 19 QUEEN I haven\'t. You should ask your father. Be sure and use small words, dear. He\'s a little slow this morning. CEDRIC Can I help you, Your Majesty? KING Ah, yes! Um...Mmm! Exquisite. What do you call this dish? CEDRIC That would be the dog\'s breakfast, Your Majesty. KING Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on, Cedric. FIONA Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek? KING No, I haven\'t, dear. I\'m sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your little spat last night. FIONA Oh. You heard that, huh? KING The whole kingdom heard you. I mean, after all, it is in his nature to bewell, a bit of a brute. FIONA Him? You know, you didn\'t exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon. KING Well, what did you expect? Look at what he\'s done to you. FIONA Shrek loves me for who I am. I would think you\'d be happy for me. KING Darling, I\'m just thinking about what\'s best for you. Maybe you should do the same. SCENE 5 FOREST SHREK [reading the potion] \"Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. For you and your true love. If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. Happiness, comfort and beauty divine.\" You both will be fine? I guess it means it\'ll affect Fiona, too. DONKEY Hey, man, this don\'t feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over. Drop that jug o\' voodoo and let\'s get out of here. SHREK It says, \"Beauty Divine.\" How bad can it be? [sniffs the potion and sneezes] DONKEY See, you\'re allergic to that stuff. You\'ll have a reaction. And if you think that I\'ll be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again! SHREK Well, here\'s to us, Fiona. DONKEY Shrek? You drink that, there\'s no going back. 20 SHREK I know. DONKEY No more wallowing in the mud? SHREK I know. DONKEY No more itchy butt crack? SHREK I know! DONKEY But you love being an ogre! SHREK I know! But I love Fiona more. DONKEY Shrek, no! Wait! SHREK drinks the potion. There\'s a long pause then...he farts DONKEY I think you grabbed the \"Farty Ever After\" potion. PUSS Maybe it\'s a dud. SHREK Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be. [Thunder cracks and he passes out] DONKEY Shrek! Black out. Fade in CASTLE INTERIOR. FIONA enters with her luggage. KING There you are! We missed you at dinner. What is it, darling? FIONA Dad...I\'ve been thinking about what you said. And I\'m going to set things right. KING Ah! Excellent! That\'s my girl. FIONA It was a mistake to bring Shrek here. I\'m going to go out and find him. And then we\'ll go back to the swamp where we belong. QUEEN Fiona, please! Let\'s not be rash, darling. You can\'t go anywhere right now. Thunder cracks again and FIONA collapses KING Fiona! 21 ACT 3 SCENE 1 IN THE BARN - MORNING SISTER Good morning, sleepyhead. I love your kitty! SHREK Oh... My head... SISTER Here, I fetched a pail of water. SHREK Thanks. Uhh! [sees his reflection in the pale] Aahh! A cute button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks? I\'m... I\'m... SISTER Gorgeous! [moves in closer] I\'m Jill. What\'s your name? SHREK Um... Shrek. SISTER Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe? SHREK looks around confused SISTER You\'re tense. I want to rub your shoulders. SHREK Have you seen my donkey? DONKEY enters and begins studying SHREK, followed by PUSS DONKEY Wow! That\'s some quality potion, Shrek! What\'s in that stuff? PUSS \"Warning: Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping. Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders.\" SHREK What? PUSS Seor? \"To make the effects of this potion permanent, the drinker must obtain his true love\'s kiss by midnight.\" SHREK Midnight? DONKEY Why is it always midnight? SISTER Pick me! I\'ll be your true love! SHREK Look, lady, I already have a true love. SISTER Oh... 22 PUSS Take it from me, Boss. You are going to have one satisfied Princess. DONKEY And let\'s face it. Even though you are a lot easier on the eyes, inside you\'re the same old mean, salty... SHREK (simultaneously) Easy. DONKEY ...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been. SHREK And you\'re still the same annoying donkey. DONKEY [Bashful] Yeah. SHREK Well...Look out, Princess. Here comes the new me. DONKEY First things first. We need to get you out of those clothes. SISTER gasps SCENE 2 THE CASTLE GATES GUARD Halt! SHREK Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her. FIONA wakes up as a human and looks at herself in the mirror. She screams SHREK Fiona! FIONA Shrek? SHREK runs into FIONA\'s room as FIONA runs down to the castle gates. FG enters the room just before SHREK, she is cloaked. SHREK Fiona? FG Hello, handsome. FIONA Shrek! DONKEY Princess! FIONA Donkey? 23 DONKEY Wow! That potion worked on you, too? FIONA What potion? DONKEY Shrek took some magic potion. And well...Now, he\'s sexy! FIONA [looking at PUSS] Shrek? PUSS For you, baby... I could be. DONKEY Yeah, you wish. FIONA Donkey, where is Shrek? DONKEY He went inside looking for you. DONKEY and PUSS exit. FIONA Shrek? SHREK Fiona! Fiona! FG [blocks his exit with her wand] Are you going so soon? Don\'t you want to see your wife? CHARMING enters CHARMING Fiona? FIONA Shrek? CHARMING Aye, Fiona. It is me. What happened to your voice? SHREK The potion changed a lot of things, Fiona. But not the way I feel about you. KING and QUEEN enter QUEEN Fiona? KING Charming? CHARMING [showing off outfit] Do you think so? [laughs] Dad. I was so hoping you\'d approve. QUEEN Um... Who are you? KING Mom, it\'s me, Shrek. I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think? [Hugs FIONA] SHREK Fiona! Fiona! 24 FG Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho! Oh, shoot! I don\'t think they can hear us, pigeon.[sighs deeply] Don\'t you think you\'ve already messed her life up enough? SHREK I just wanted her to be happy. FG And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart. She\'s finally found the prince of her dreams. SHREK But look at me. Look what I\'ve done for her. FG It\'s time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek. She\'s a princess, and you\'re an ogre. That\'s something no amount of potion will ever change. SHREK But...I love her. FG If you really love her... you\'ll let her go. SHREK leaves SCENE 3 THE UGLY STEPSISTER\'S TAVERN SISTER Here you go, boys. PUSS Just leave the bottle, Doris. SISTER Hey. Why the long face? SHREK It was all just a stupid mistake. I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place. PUSS I hate Mondays. DONKEY I can\'t believe you\'d walk away from the best thing that happened to you. SHREK What choice do I have? She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming. DONKEY Come on. Is he really that good-looking? SISTER Are you kidding? He\'s gorgeous! He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels. PUSS Oh. He sounds dreamy. 25 SHREK You know...shockingly, this isn\'t making me feel any better. Look, guys. It\'s for the best. Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she\'s always dreamed of. Everybody wins. DONKEY Except for you. I don\'t get it, Shrek. You love Fiona. SHREK Aye. And that\'s why I have to let her go. KING enters in a cloak, at the back of the tavern. KING Excuse me, is she here? GUARD She\'s, uh... in the back. KING Oh, hello again. Fairy Godmother. Charming. FG You\'d better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold. KING Well, I\'m afraid Fiona isn\'t really... warming up to Prince Charming. CHARMING FYI, not my fault. FG No, of course it\'s not, dear. CHARMING I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I\'m that dreadful ogre? KING No, no, it\'s nobody\'s fault. Perhaps it\'s best if we just call the whole thing off, okay? FG and CHARMING What? KING You can\'t force someone to fall in love! FG I beg to differ. I do it all the time! [pulls out a magical potion from her bag] Have Fiona drink this and she\'ll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming. KING Umm... no. FG What did you say? KING I can\'t. I won\'t do it. FG Oh, yes, you will. If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after. And I can take it away just as easily. Is that what you want? Is it? 26 KING No. FG Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need to do Charming\'s hair before the ball. He\'s hopeless. He\'s all high in the front. He can never get to the back. You need someone to do the back. CHARMING Oh. Thank you, Mother. DONKEY Mother? FG The ogre! Stop them! Stop them! The guards grab SHREK, DONKEY and PUSS and all exit SCENE 4 IN THE CASTLE The KING enters with a pair of tea cups. He pours the poison into one of them, just before FIONA enters. KING Darling? Ah. I thought I might find you here. How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball? FIONA I\'m not going. KING The whole Kingdom\'s turned out to celebrate your marriage. FIONA There\'s just one problem. That\'s not my husband. I mean, look at him. KING Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love. You\'d be surprised how much I changed for your mother. FIONA Change? He\'s completely lost his mind! KING Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance? You might find you like this new Shrek. FIONA But it\'s the old one I fell in love with, Dad. I\'d give anything to have him back. [reached for one of the tea cups] KING Darling. That\'s mine. Decaf. Otherwise I\'m up all night. FIONA [drinking from the other cup] Thanks. 27 SCENE 5 THE DUNGEON DONKEY I got to get out of here! I got to get out of here! You can\'t lock us up like this! Let me go! What about my Miranda rights? You\'re supposed to say I have the right to remain silent. Nobody said I have the right to remain silent! SHREK You HAVE the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity. PUSS I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad. PINOCHIO Shrek? Donkey? PUSS Too late. SHREK Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here! GINGY Quick! Tell a lie! PINOCHIO What should I say? SHREK Anything, but quick! GINGY Say something crazy like, \"I\'m wearing ladies\' underwear!\" PINOCHIO I am wearing ladies\' underwear. SHREK Are you? PINOCHIO I most certainly am not! [his nose grows] DONKEY It looks like you most certainly am are! PINOCHIO I am not! PUSS What kind? GINGY [looking in the back of PINOCHIO\'s lederhosen] It\'s a thong! PINOCHIO Oww! They\'re briefs! GINGY Are not. PINOCHIO Are too! GINGY Here we go. Hang tight. [picks the lock with PINOCHIO\'s nose] SHREK Okay boys! We\'ve got to stop that kiss! 28 DONKEY I thought you was going to let her go. SHREK I was, but I can\'t let them do this to Fiona. DONKEY Boom! That\'s what I like to hear. Look who\'s coming around! PINOCHIO It\'s impossible! You\'ll never get in. The castle\'s guarded. There\'s a moat and everything! [nose shrinks back down] GINGY Folks, it looks like we\'re up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick. SHREK Don\'t worry guys, I have a plan. To the castle! SCENE 6 THE ROYAL BALL ROYAL MESSENGER Ladies and gentlemen. Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek. AUDIENCE applauses, cheering. CHARMING begins waving and encouraging the audience FIONA Shrek, what are you doing? CHARMING I\'m just playing the part, Fiona. FIONA Is that glitter on your lips? CHARMING Mm. Cherry flavored. Want to taste? FIONA Ugh! What is with you? CHARMING But, Muffin Cake... FIONA gets fed up and turns to leave, CHARMING looks at FG for help. FG [Sotto Voce] Play something! Now! [turns to the AUDIENCE] Ladies and gentlemen. I\'d like to dedicate this song to... Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek. CHARMING Fiona, my Princess. Will you honor me with a dance? AUDIENCE Dance! Dance! FIONA Since when do you dance? 29 CHARMING Fiona, my dearest, if there\'s one thing I know, it\'s that love is full of surprises. OUTSIDE THE BALL All right, fellas! Let\'s crash this party! GUARD Halt right there! GINGY Make me! GUARD grabs GINGY by the collar GINGY Not the gumdrop button! DONKEY and PUSS grab the GUARD DONKEY Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go! SHREK exits PUSS Today, I repay my debt. GUARD yells and is chased offstage by PUSS. DONKEY, PINOCHIO and GINGY FOLLOW SHREK Stop! Hey, you! Back away from my wife. FIONA Shrek? FG You couldn\'t just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone. SHREK Pinocchio! Get the wand! PINOCHIO runs for the wand but gets zapped along the way. His PINOCHIO\' nose is gone. PINOCHIO I\'m a real boy! The WOLF barges in and blows the wand out of FG\'s hand, GINGY picks it up and accidentally zaps PINOCHIO, his wooden nose appears again. PINOCHIO I\'m a real boy. Aah! Oh. FG That\'s mine! PUSS and DONKEY enter DONKEY Pray for mercy, from Puss... PUSS and Donkey! FG She\'s taken the potion! Kiss her now! CHARMING kisses FIONA 30 SHREK No! CHARMING and FIONA look at eachother longingly, SHREK is heartbroken. FIONA (headbutting CHARMING) Hya! ALL gasp SHREK Fiona. FIONA Shrek. SHREK and FIONA embrace FG Harold! You were supposed to give her the potion! KING Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea. CHARMING [snatching the wand and tossing it back to FG] Mommy! FIONA Mommy? FG I told you. Ogres don\'t live happily ever after. FG tries to zap SHREK but KING grabs the wand. They both disappear. FIONA Oh, Dad![sobbing] PINOCHIO Is he...? GINGY Yup. He croaked. Croak sound can be heard. FIONA picks up a frog QUEEN Harold? FIONA Dad? KING I\'d hoped you\'d never see me like this. DONKEY And he gave you a hard time! SHREK Donkey! KING No, no, he\'s right. I\'m sorry. To both of you. I only wanted what was best for Fiona. But I can see now... she already has it. Shrek, Fiona... Will you accept an old frog\'s apologies... and my blessing? QUEEN Harold? KING I\'m sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be the man you deserve. 31 QUEEN You\'re more that man today than you ever were... warts and all. Clock chimes PUSS Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion! SHREK Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you want? To be this way forever? FIONA What? SHREK Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this. FIONA You\'d do that? For me? SHREK Yes. FIONA I want what any princess wants. To live happily ever after, [SHREK leans in to kiss her but she stops him] with the ogre I married. PUSS Whatever happens, I must not cry! You cannot make me cry! [sobs] Clock chimes. Flashing lights, as the crowd gathers round and reveals the ogre SHREK and FIONA SHREK Now, where were we? Oh. I remember. Fade out. Spotlight on DONKEY. DONKEY Hey! Isn\'t we supposed to be having a fiesta? FANFARE"
